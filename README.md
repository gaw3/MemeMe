# ![][AppIcon]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MemeMe

MemeMe allows the user to affix captions to the top and bottom of a selected photo, thereby creating a [meme][Meme]. The user may then choose to distribute the meme to others via email or text.  As memes are sent, they are collected & held until the app terminates.  Previously-sent memes are presented in a table or a collection, and may be edited & resent.

## Design

Upon app launch, the initial view is the **Sent Memes Tabbed View** with the **Table** tab activated.  There is no persistence in this app, so there are [no sent memes to display][NoMemes].  As memes are created and distributed, a memory store keeps track of these [memes for appropriate presentation][SomeMemes]. However, upon app termination, all these memes are lost.

* The **Table** tab is the default tab, and presents the memes in a table view.  Each row contains a sent meme, with the top & bottom legends appearing to the side.
  - Tap a row to present the meme in the [Meme Detail View][MDV].
  - Left-Swipe a row to present the option to [delete][DeleteMeme] the associated meme from the memory store.<br/><br/>
* The **Collection** tab presents the memes in a collection view.  Each cell contains a sent meme.
  - Tap a cell to present the meme in the [Meme Detail View][MDV].<br/><br/>
* The tabs share a common navigation bar:
  - Tap the **Add** button (&nbsp;![][AddButton], right side, always visible) to present an [empty Meme Editor View][EmptyMEV], in order to create and send a meme.
  - Tap the **Edit** button (left side, visible for **Table** tab only) to present an [interface][TableEdit] for deleting and reordering sent memes.
