# ![App Icon](./Paperwork/images/MemeMeAppIcon_80.png)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MemeMe

MemeMe allows the user to affix captions to the top and bottom of a selected photo, thereby creating a [meme](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/MemeDefinition.md). The user may then choose to distribute the meme to others via email or text.  As memes are sent, they are collected & held until the app terminates.  Previously-sent memes are presented in a table or a collection, and may be edited & resent.

## Design

Upon app launch, the initial view is the Sent Memes Tabbed View  with the **Table** tab activated.  There is no persistence in this app, so there are [no sent memes to display](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/SentMemesEmpty.md).  As memes are created and distributed, a memory store keeps track of these [memes for appropriate presentation](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/SentMemesFull.md). However, upon app termination, all these memes are lost.

  * The **Table** tab is the default tab, and presents the memes in a table view.  Each row contains a sent meme, with the top & bottom legends appearing to the side.
    - Tap a roow to present the meme in the [Meme Detail View](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/MemeDetailView.md).
    - Left-Swipe a row to present the option to [delete](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/SwipeLeftOnRow.md) the associated meme from the memory store.<br/><br/>
  * The **Collection** tab presents the memes in a collection view.  Each cell contains only a sent meme.
    - Tap a cell to present the meme in the [Meme Detail View](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/MemeDetailView.md).<br/><br/>
  * The tabs share a common navigation bar:
    - Tap the **Add** button (&nbsp;![](./Paperwork/images/AddButtonIcon_15.png), right side, always visible) to present an [empty Meme Editor View](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/MemeEditorView.md), in order to create and send a meme.
    - Tap the **Edit** button (left side, visible for **Table** tab only) to present an [interface](./Paperwork/READMEFiles/TableEditMode.md) for deleting and reordering sent memes.
